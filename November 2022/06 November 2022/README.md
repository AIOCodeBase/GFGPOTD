# Minimum number of Coins

**Medium**

Given an **infinite supply** of each denomination of Indian currency { **1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 2000** } and a target value **N**.  
Find the **minimum** number of coins and/or notes needed to make the change for Rs **N**. You must return the list containing the value of coins required.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: N = 43
Output: 20 20 2 1
Explaination:
Minimum number of coins and notes needed
to make 43.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: N = 1000
Output: 500 500
Explaination: minimum possible notes
is 2 notes of 500.
```

**Your Task:**  
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **minPartition()** which takes the value N as input parameter and returns a list of integers in decreasing order.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(N)

**Constraints:**  
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
