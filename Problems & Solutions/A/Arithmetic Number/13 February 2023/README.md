# **Arithmetic Number**

## **Easy**

Given three integers  **'A'** denoting the first term of an arithmetic sequence , **'C'** denoting the common difference of an arithmetic sequence and an integer **'B'**. you need to tell whether 'B' exists in the arithmetic sequence or not. Return 1 if B is present in the sequence. Otherwise, returns 0.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = 1, B = 3, C = 2
Output: 1
Explaination: 3 is the second term of the 
sequence starting with 1 and having a common 
difference 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3
Output: 0
Explaination: 2 is not present in the sequence.
```

**Your Task:**  
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **inSequence()** which takes A, B and C and returns 1 if B is present in the sequence. Otherwise, returns 0.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)  
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(1)  

**Constraints:**

$-10^9$ ≤ A, B, C ≤ $10^9$
