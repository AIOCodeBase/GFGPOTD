# **Array Pair Sum Divisibility Problem**

## **Easy**

Given an array of integers and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.

**Example 1 :**

```
Input : arr = [9, 5, 7, 3], k = 6
Output: True
Explanation: {(9, 3), (5, 7)} is a
possible solution. 9 + 3 = 12 is divisible
by 6 and 7 + 5 = 12 is also divisible by 6.


```

**Example 2:**

```
Input : arr = [2, 4, 1, 3], k = 4
Output: False
Explanation: There is no possible solution.
```

**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **canPair()** which takes array and k as input parameter and returns true if array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k otherwise returns false.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Expected Space Complexity :** O(n)

**Constraints:**  
1 &lt;= length of array &lt;= 10^5  
1 &lt;= elements of array &lt;= 10^5  
1 &lt;= k &lt;= 10^5
