# **k-th smallest element in BST**

## **Medium**

Given a BST and an integer K. Find the Kth Smallest element in the BST using O(1) extra space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
      2
    /   \
   1     3
K = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 is the 2nd smallest element in the BST

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
        2
      /  \
     1    3
K = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no 5th smallest element in the BST as the size of BST is 3
```

**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **KthSmallestElement()** which takes the root of the BST and integer K as inputs and return the Kth smallest element in the BST, if no such element exists return -1.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1).

**Constraints:**  
1&lt;=Number of nodes&lt;=100000
