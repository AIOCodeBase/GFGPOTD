# **Find patterns**

## **Medium**

Given two strings S and W. Find the number of times W appears as a subsequence of string S where every character of string S can be included in forming at most one subsequence.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
 S = "abcdrtbwerrcokokokd"
 W = "bcd"
Output:
 2
Explanation:
The two subsequences of string W are
{ S1 , S2 , S3 } and { S6 , S11 , S18 }
(Assuming 0- based indexing).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
S = "ascfret"
W = "qwer"
Output:
0
Explanation:
No valid subsequences are possible.
```

**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **numberOfSubsequences()** which takes the string S and string W as input parameters and returns the number of subsequences of string W in string S.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N^2)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(N)

**Constraints:**  
1&lt;=|S|&lt;=1000  
1&lt;=|W|&lt;=|S|
