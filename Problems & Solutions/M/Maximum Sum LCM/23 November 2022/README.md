# **Maximum Sum LCM**

## **Easy**

Given a positive number n. You need to write a program to find the maximum sum of distinct numbers such that the LCM of all these numbers is equal to n.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 3 
Explanation: The distinct numbers you can have are
just 1 and 2 and their sum is equal to 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The distinct numbers you can have
are just 1 and 5 and their sum is equal to 6.

```

**Your Task:**  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function **maxSumLCM()** which takes n as input parameter and returns the maximum sum of distinct numbers such that the LCM of all these numbers is equal to n.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(sqrt(n))  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
1&lt;= N &lt;=1000000000
