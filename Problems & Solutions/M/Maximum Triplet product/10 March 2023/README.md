# **Maximum Triplet product**

## **Medium**

Given an array arr of size n, the task is to find the maximum triplet product in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5}
Output:
30
Explanation:
5*3*2 gives 30. This is the maximum possible
triplet product in the array.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
n = 7
arr[] = {-3, -5, 1, 0, 8, 3, -2} 
Output:
120
Explanation: 
-3*-5*8 gives 120. This is the maximum possible triplet product in the array.
```

**Your Task:**  

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxTripletProduct() which takes an integer n and an array arr and returns the maximum triplet product in the array.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(1)    

**Constraints:**

3 ≤ N ≤ 5 * $10^5$  
$-10^6$ ≤ A[i] ≤ $10^6$
