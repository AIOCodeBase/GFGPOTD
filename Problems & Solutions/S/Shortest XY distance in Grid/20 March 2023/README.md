# **Shortest XY distance in Grid**

## **Medium**

Give a N*M grid of characters 'O', 'X', and 'Y'. Find the minimum Manhattan distance between a X and a Y.

Manhattan Distance :
| row_index_x - row_index_y | + | column_index_x - column_index_y |

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
N = 4, M = 4
grid  = {{X, O, O, O}
         {O, Y, O, Y}
         {X, X, O, O}
         {O, Y, O, O}}
Output:
1
Explanation:
{{X, O, O, O}
{O, Y, O, Y}
{X, X, O, O}
{O, Y, O, O}}
The shortest X-Y distance in the grid is 1.
One possible such X and Y are marked in bold
in the above grid.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
N = 3, M = 3
grid = {{X, X, O}
        {O, O, Y}
        {Y, O, O}}
Output :
2
Explanation:
{{X, X, O}
 {O, O, Y}
 {Y, O, O}}
The shortest X-Y distance in the grid is 2.
One possible such X and Y are marked in bold
in the above grid.
```

**Your Task:**  

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function shortestXYDist() which takes two integers N, and M and an 2D list of size N*M as input and returns the shortest Manhattan Distance between a X and a Y.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N * M)  
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(N * M)    

**Constraints:**

1 ≤ N * M ≤ $10^5$
