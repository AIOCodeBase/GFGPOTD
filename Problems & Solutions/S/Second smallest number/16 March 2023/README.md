# **Second smallest number**

## **Medium**

The task is to find the second smallest number with a given sum of digits as S and the number of digits as D.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
S = 9 
D = 2
Output:
27
Explanation:
18 is the smallest number possible with sum = 9
and total digits = 2, Whereas the second
smallest is 27.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
S = 16
D = 3
Output:
178
Explanation:
169 is the smallest number possible with sum is
16 and total digits = 3, Whereas the second
smallest is 178.
```

**Your Task:**  

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function secondSmallest() which takes the two integers S and D respectively and returns a string which is the second smallest number if possible, else return "-1".

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(D)  
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(1)    

**Constraints:**

1 ≤ S ≤ $10^5$  
1 ≤ D ≤ $10^5$
