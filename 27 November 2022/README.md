# **Add Binary Strings**

## **Medium**

Given two binary strings **A** and **B** consisting of only 0s and 1s. Find the resultant string after adding the two Binary Strings.  
**Note:** The input strings may contain leading zeros but the output string should not have any leading zeros.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
A = "1101", B = "111"
Output: 10100
Explanation:
 1101
+ 111
10100
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
A = "10", B = "01"
Output: 11
Explanation:
  10
+ 01
  11
```

**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **addBinary()** which takes 2 binary string A and B and **returns** a binary string denoting the addition of both the strings.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(max(|A|, |B|)).  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(max(|A|, |B|)) (for output string).

**Constraints:**  
1 ≤ |A|, |B| ≤ 10^6
