# **Alternate Vowel and Consonant String**

## **Medium**

Given a string **S** of **lowercase** english characters. Rearrange characters of the given string such that the vowels and consonants occupy **alternate** positions and the string so formed should be **lexicographically** (alphabetically) **smallest.**  
**Note:** Vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
S = "aeroplane"
Output: alanepero
Explanation: alanepero
The vowels and cosonants are arranged
alternatively with vowels shown in bold.
Also, there's no lexicographically smaller
string possible with required conditions.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
S = "mississippi"
Output: -1
Explanation: The number of vowels is 4
whereas the number of consonants is 7.
Hence, there's no way to arrange the
vowels and consonants alternatively.
```

**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **rearrange()** which takes the string **S** and its size **N** as inputs and **returns** the modified string as stated in the description. If such a modification is not possible, return the string "-1".

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(2\*26).

**Constraints:**  
1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^6  
'a' &lt;= S\[ i \] &lt;= 'z'
