# **LCM Triplet**

## **Medium**

Given a number N.Find the maximum possible LCM that can be attained by any three numbers less than or equal to N.  
Note- LCM stands for Lowest Common Multiple. Also, Numbers can be repeated.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
N=9
Output:
504
Explanation:
504 is the maximum LCM that can be attained
by any triplet of numbers less than or equal 9.
The triplet which has this LCM is {7,8,9}.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
N=7
Output:
210
Explanation:
210 is the maximum LCM that can be attained
by any triplet of numbers less than or equal 7.
The triplet which has this LCM is {5,6,7}.
```

**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **lcmTriplets()** that takes a number N as input parameter and returns the maximum LCM that can be attained by any three numbers less than or equal to N.

**Expected Time Complexity:**O(logN)  
**Expected Auxillary Space:**O(logN)

**Constraints:**

- ` 1 <= N <= 10^6 `
