# **Count the substrings**

## **Hard**

Given a binary string S consists only of 0s and 1s. The task is to calculate the number of substrings that have more 1s than 0s.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
S = "011"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substring which 
has more 1s than 0s. i.e "011","1","11" and "1"
```

  
**Example 2:**

```
Input:
S = "0000"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no substring
which has more 1s than 0s

```

  
**Your Task:**   
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function countSubstring() which takes the string S as input parameter and returns the number of substring which has more 1s than 0s.
  
**Expected Time Complexity:** O(|S|)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(|S|)

  
**Constraints:**  
1 < |S| < 105
|S| denotes the length of the string S
